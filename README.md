This project is called Grove.

It allows a user to create, delete, and check off habits, and earn a point for each habit they do. Each point gets them higher up the leaderboard, competing with other users to see who can be the best habit completer.

I created this project based on an idea I had in the shower, namely, what it I combined a habit tracker, a common beginners project, with Duolingo?
It would keep my users motivated, and possibly be instrumental in developing good habits for them.

I made this project by doing small steps every day, even if the small step was just formatting a button. I knew it would be a big undertaking, and didn't want to get burnt out. I used Node and Express, along with EJS and CSS to make a static website. Then, I added functionality within each route, as well as frontend JS and a database connection to make it fully functioning.

This project came with a massive learning curve. I learnt *heaps* of things while creating it, including but not limited to:

- How to use Node JS 
- How to use Express
- How to use EJS
- How to connect Postgres to a NodeJS application
- How to create, update, and delete database data using code in the app
- How to fetch data using code in the app
- How to use Google OAuth with Passport
- How to use Google icons
- How to create a hamburger menu
- How to track HTML elements with JS
 

I found this project quite challenging -- it was a big learning curve, as previously mentioned. However,  I learnt to use online resources efficiently and effectively to find answers to my questions and learn how to do new things. Some of the most prominent challenges included not knowing how to use a new technology and debugging by app, especially the backend.
